        At sixteen I started programming,<br> Though late I may have been,<br> Resolved to make the most of it,
        <br>Python I took to
        keen;<br><br>

        Games I found more enjoyable<br> Than playing them to pass the time,<br> By seventeen C# and Unity<br> My skills
        had
        reached
        their prime;
        <br><br>
        Now I'm studying hard for BCA<br> To take my skills beyond,<br> Creating games and more to come <br>Before this
        story's
        done.
